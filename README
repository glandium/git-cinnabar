git-cinnabar 0.3
================

When you update, please read this file again, it may contain
important notes.

[ cinnabar is the common natural form in which mercury can be found on
  Earth. It contains mercury sulfide and its powder is used to make
  the vermillion pigment. ]

git-cinnabar is a git remote helper to interact with mercurial
repositories. Contrary to other such helpers[*], it doesn't use a
local mercurial clone under the hood, although it currently does
require mercurial to be installed for some of its libraries.

* This applies to the following tools:
  - https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg
  - https://github.com/rfk/git-remote-hg
  - https://github.com/cosmin/git-hg
  - https://github.com/todesschaf/git-hg
  - https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/wiki/Guide-to-git-remote-hg
  - https://github.com/buchuki/gitifyhg/

The main focus at the moment is to make it work with mozilla-central
and related mercurial repositories and support Mozilla workflows (try
server, etc.).

This version of git-cinnabar changed the metadata structure
substantially, such that using a repository that was last used with
versions 0.1.0 to 0.2.2 requires a full checkup with `git cinnabar
fsck`. git-cinnabar will ask you to do so. Repositories last used with
versions lower than 0.1.0 are not supported. Please run a command such
as `git ls-remote $remote` with version 0.1.x or 0.2.x first.

Setup:
------

- Install mercurial.
- Add this directory to your PATH. If you have another git-remote-hg project
  in your PATH already, make sure the git-cinnabar path comes before.

Alternatively to the latter, you can do the following to build a native
helper for faster operation:
  $ git submodule update --init
  Then see git-core/INSTALL for build/install instructions, but run the
  commands in this directory. This will build/install git as well as
  the tools from this directory. Note that if you have a non-standard Python
  installation location (for example if you are on OSX and have installed
  it using homebrew) you need to pass --with-python=/path/to/python to the
  configure script or set the PYTHON_PATH environment variable to your Python
  installation path when using make to build this tool.

Usage:
------

$ git clone hg::<mercurial repo>

where <mercurial repo> can be a path to a local directory containing a
mercurial repository, or a http, https or ssh url.

Essentially, use git like you would for a git repository, but use a
hg:: url where you would use a git:// url.

Mercurial bookmarks are exposed as `refs/heads/bookmarks/$bookmark` remote
refs. If you want to interact exclusively with mercurial with bookmarks,
you can use a refspec like `refs/heads/bookmarks/*:refs/remotes/$remote/*`.

Mercurial branches are exposed as namespaces under `refs/heads/branches/`.
As mercurial branches can have multiple heads, each head is exposed
as `refs/heads/branches/$branch/$head`, where `$head` is the mercurial sha1
of the head changeset. There is however an exception to that pattern,
for the tip changeset of the branch, which is exposed as
`refs/heads/branches/$branch/tip`. If you only care about the tip changeset
of each branch, you can use a refspec like
`refs/heads/branches/*/tip:refs/remotes/$remote/*`.

See http://glandium.org/blog/?page_id=3438 for an example workflow for
Mozilla repositories.

Translating git commits to mercurial changesets and vice-versa:
---------------------------------------------------------------

When dealing with a remote repository that doesn't use the same
identifiers, things can easily get complicated. Git-cinnabar comes
with commands to know the mercurial changeset a git commit represents
and the other way around.

The following command will give you the git commit corresponding to
the given mercurial changeset sha1:

$ git cinnabar hg2git <changeset>

The following command will give you the mercurial changeset
corresponding to the given git commit sha1:

$ git cinnabar git2hg <commit>

Both commands allow abbreviated forms, as long as they are unambiguous
(no need for all the 40 hex digits of the sha1).

Avoiding metadata:
------------------

In some cases, it is not desirable to have git-cinnabar create metadata
for all pushed commits. Notably, for volatile commits such as those
used on the Mozilla try repository.

By default, git-cinnabar doesn't store metadata when pushing to
non-publishing repositories. It does otherwise.

This behavior can be changed per-remote with a remote.$remote.cinnabar-data
preference with one of the following values:
- `always`
- `never`
- `phase`

`phase` is the default described above. `always` and `never` are
self-explanatory.

Limitations:
------------

At the moment, push is limited to non-merge commits.

Pushing to a local mercurial repository (hg::/path) only works with
mercurial 3.0 or later.

There is no support for the following mercurial features:
- obsolescence markers
- phases
- namespaces

Checking corruptions:
---------------------

Git-cinnabar is still in early infancy, and its metadata might get
corrupted for some reason.

The following command allows to detect various types of metadata
corruption:
  git cinnabar fsck

This command will fix the corruptions it can, as well as adjust some
of the metadata that contains items that became unnecessary in newer
versions.

The `--manifests` and `--files` options may be added for additional
validation on manifests and files. Using either or both adds a
significant amount of work, and the command can take more than half
an hour on repositories the size of mozilla-central.

hg:// urls:
-----------

The msys shell (not msys2) doesn't keep hg::url intact when crossing the
msys/native boundary, so when running cinnabar in a msys shell with a
native git, the url is munged as hg;;proto;\host\path\, which git
doesn't understand and doesn't even start redirecting to git-remote-hg.

To allow such setups to still work, hg:// urls are supported. But since
mercurial can be either on many different protocols, we abuse the port
in the given url to pass the protocol.

A hg:// url thus looks like:

  hg://<host>[:[<port>.]<protocol>]/<path>

The default protocol is https, and the port can be omitted.

  hg::https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
    becomes
  hg://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central

  hg::http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
    becomes
  hg://hg.mozilla.org:http/mozilla-central

  hg::ssh://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
    becomes
  hg://hg.mozilla.org:ssh/mozilla-central

  hg::file:///some/path
    becomes (awkward)
  hg://:file/some/path

  hg::http://localhost:8080/foo
    becomes
  hg://localhost:8080.http/foo
